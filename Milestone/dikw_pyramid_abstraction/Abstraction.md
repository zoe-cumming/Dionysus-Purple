# Data
## raw values and measurements
The raw values will include the "temparature", PDM files, the esp32 camera pixels and distance

# Information
## Who, what, when, where
From this it can be found that "the temperature is 24.5", "there was a clap detected", "a hand was detected at 50cm" and "a group of pixels were taken and grouped together"

# Knowledge
## information with experience
Using the fact a clap was detected, the lights in the room will toggle on and off
Using the fact a hand was detected within 50cm, a photo of the camera should be taken
Using the fact a photo was taken, the pixels should be alligned so that the users desired fan setting can be determined
Using the fact the temperature is over 30 degrees, the fan speed should be increased to aid in cooling

# Wisdom
## knowledge with action
Although a distance within the threshold was taken, only take a photo of fingers can be detected
